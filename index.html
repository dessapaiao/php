    I lost it all in a beach community,
Where it was lost is not all that clear to me.
Over the sidewalk, into a slow talk.
Call the police!
Told me I'm in the wrong town.
Wait for your cue 'cause my scene it ain't over.
I torch up your house while your kids are at home.
What can you do when you're not getting sober?
It's hard to admit but you're always feeling alone.
You're always feeling alone.
You're always just a few miles down 
as the streets count backwards, 
I realize it's true.
Everything reminds me of you.
A few miles down, 
As the streets count backwards,
I realize it's true.

     it's a wonderful day

    <section id="3">
   You're the worst in turn, the first of the night.
Who could stand there staring at the blacks of your eyes?
What a curious type, reaching out for the iron.
To never ask for a slap, but don't indulge in a smile.
We're twenty-first dead rats again.

You're the worst in turn, the first of the hour.
I can feel it creeping on me out of the shower.
Like a film on a postcard, a moment entranced,
And with the confidence of prom queens insist on me asking.

Well say it was me, who's getting sick on my jeans,
Just as I thought about the part that goes: "You're such a disease."

Go on and call around, after I've been put down.
So fucking empty when it hits you'll hear a hollow sound.
I'm twenty-first dead rats again.
